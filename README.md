# React.js Treasure Hunt 

## User stories 

* As a player, I can see a web page with a 3 by 3 grid board game with question marks in each square
* As a player, when I click on one of the question marks, an alert appears with the id of the position in the grid
* As a player, when I click on one of the question marks, instead of the alert the space turns into a tree icon (In order to focus on the functionality of this step, you can start with switching the ‘?’ to the word ‘tree’)
* As a player, I can click on the question marks and behind one of the question marks is a treasure box icon and an alert appears with the text “You Win”
* As a player, I can see a counter that shows how many guesses I have left (starting at 9, 8, 7, etc)
* As a player, I can see a “win” or “lose” message when the game is won or lost
* As a player, I can click on a “Play Again” button to restart the game
